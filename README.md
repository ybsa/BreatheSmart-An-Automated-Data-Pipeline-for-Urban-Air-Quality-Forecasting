BreatheSmart is an end-to-end data engineering and science platform designed to forecast urban air quality. By automating the collection of live pollutant data (PM2.5, NO2) via the OpenAQ API, the system builds a robust historical dataset to train predictive models.

The Problem: Urban residents often lack hyper-local, predictive insights to plan outdoor activities safely. The Solution: An automated pipeline that ingests, cleans, and analyzes air quality data to provide 6-hour forecasts with an emphasis on sensor bias mitigation in under-represented neighborhoods.
